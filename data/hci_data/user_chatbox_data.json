      "grpo_step126": "assistant\n\nThe normal range for heart rate (HR) can vary depending on age, fitness level, and other factors. Here are the normal ranges for heart rate:\n\n* Newborns (0-1 month): 100-160 beats per minute (bpm)\n* Infants (1-12 months): 80-160 bpm\n* Children (1-12 years): 70-100 bpm\n* Adolescents (13-18 years): 60-100 bpm\n* Adults (18-64 years): 60-100 bpm\n* Athletes: 40-100 bpm\n* Older adults (65 years and older): 50-90 bpm\n\nIt's also worth noting that heart rate can vary throughout the day, and some people may have a normal heart rate that is higher or lower than these ranges.\n\nIn general, a heart rate that is too high or too low can be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as:\n\n* Tachycardia (heart rate above 100 bpm): can be a sign of anxiety, dehydration, or an underlying cardiac condition\n* Bradycardia (heart rate below 60 bpm): can be a sign of heart block, heart failure, or an underlying cardiac condition\n\nIf you have concerns about your heart rate or any other symptoms, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and diagnosis."
