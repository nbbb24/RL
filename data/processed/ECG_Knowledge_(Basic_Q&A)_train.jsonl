This finding reflects increased right ventricular mass and is used to diagnose RVH."}
{"question": "How does a \"deep S-wave\" in lead V1 combined with a \"tall R-wave\" in lead V6 help diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH)?", "answer": "A deep S-wave in lead V1 combined with a tall R-wave in lead V6 helps diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The combined voltage of these leads often exceeds 35 mm, indicating increased left ventricular mass."}
{"question": "How does the presence of \"Osborn waves\" (J-waves) in the ECG indicate hypothermia, and in which leads are these waves typically found?", "answer": "The presence of Osborn waves (J-waves) in the ECG indicates hypothermia and is typically found in the precordial leads (V3-V5). These waves are positive deflections at the end of the QRS complex, associated with decreased body temperature."}
{"question": "What does the \"presence of J-waves (Osborn waves)\" in the ECG indicate about a patient's body temperature and potential hypothermia?", "answer": "The presence of J-waves (Osborn waves) in the ECG indicates decreased body temperature and potential hypothermia. These waves are positive deflections at the end of the QRS complex, commonly seen in hypothermic patients."}
{"question": "How does a \"short PR interval\" with a \"wide QRS complex\" suggest a pre-excitation syndrome, and which leads are most useful for this diagnosis?", "answer": "A short PR interval with a wide QRS complex suggests a pre-excitation syndrome, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. The most useful leads for this diagnosis are the precordial leads (V1-V3), where the delta wave is often observed."}
