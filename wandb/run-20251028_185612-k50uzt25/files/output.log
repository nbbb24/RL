What does the "presence of a delta wave" in the ECG suggest about Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, and which leads are most helpful for identifying this condition?assistant


[response] The presence of a delta wave in the ECG suggests Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome.

The leads most helpful for identifying this condition are the inferior and lateral leads.
[ground_truth] The presence of a delta wave in the ECG suggests Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, with the most helpful leads being V1-V3. This wave indicates pre-excitation of the ventricles due to an accessory conduction pathway.
